    <!-- When you add a <script> tag to your HTML, it runs synchronously by default, meaning it blocks HTML rendering until the JavaScript file is downloaded and executed. You can control this behavior with the defer and async attributes:

        defer: Downloads the script while the HTML is being parsed and executes it after the HTML is fully parsed. This ensures the script runs only after the document is ready.
        <script defer src="./app.js"></script>
        
        async: Downloads the script while the HTML is being parsed and executes it as soon as itâ€™s downloaded. This can speed up page load times but may cause issues if the script depends on elements not yet available in the DOM. 
        <script async src="./app.js"></script> -->
